# Patient-Priority-Scoring-Triage-Predictor-
A PyTorch-based neural network that predicts patient urgency levels (Low, Medium, High) from vitals and symptoms. It uses two hidden layers with softmax output, trained via manual sdg and L2 regularization. Demonstrates ML concepts like backward propagation, activation funct, and manual weight updates, with potential for future upgrades to CNN/RNN.
